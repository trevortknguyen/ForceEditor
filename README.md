# ForceEditor
Originally, this was made as a hackathon project for CodeDay Dallas 2015 created by Andrew Trewin and Trevor Nguyen. It now uses OpenGL through LWJGL3. It is a video game in which the player moves across the map collecting resources and defeating opponents. An inspiration of the game was the previously popular game agar.io. At the CodeDay Dallas competition, it won the Best Video Game award among judges.

## Current Tasks
In order to improve this project, it needs to be updated and optimized to use vertex buffer objects rather than OpenGL immediate mode. This is expected to increase performance dramatically.

## Other goals

* reduce amount of static code
* create ui
* allow keybindings
* modularize game engine
